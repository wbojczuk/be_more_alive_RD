    <p><strong>Dear Pastor and Church Leadership</strong>, My name is Michael Hall, and I serve as the founder and Chaplain Be‑More Alive Ministry here in Asheville, a Christ‑centered men’s discipleship and development ministry. 
The heart of this work is to walk with men—especially those navigating hardship or major life transition—into a deeper, more alive relationship with Jesus that transforms how they lead, love, and serve in their homes and communities. Out of that same burden for men and families, Be‑More Alive Ministry is hosting the Faith Family Foundation Event in February 2026. This will be a one‑evening, faith‑based celebration designed to strengthen families across Asheville through a Father–Daughter Dance, Mother–Son Dance, Couple Dance, and special Promise Ceremonies where parents speak blessings and commitments over their children.
<br /><br />
In a county where roughly 30% of households with children are led by a single parent, many families rarely experience safe, joy‑filled spaces to connect, heal, and build memories together. 
Events like Faith Family Foundation give parents and children shared experiences that:Reinforce Christ‑centered identity and purpose.Model healthy, loving relationships.Break cycles of isolation and discouragement, especially for single‑parent and low‑income families. 
<br /><br />
To make this night accessible to families regardless of income, we are seeking local church partners to help us meet a modest event budget of $3,825. This covers facility rental, food and décor, a DJ, photographer, and small gifts for families so the evening feels special and dignifying. 
Your church can partner with us through:Financial sponsorship at any level.In‑kind donations (catering, decorations, photography, or professional services).Volunteers to help host, greet, and serve families on the night of the event. 
<br /><br />
Be‑More Alive Ministry is a registered 501(c)(3), so all contributions are tax‑deductible. More importantly, your partnership will create a safe, Christ‑honoring environment where fathers, mothers, and children can reconnect, receive blessing, and build memories that point them back to the love of the Father.
